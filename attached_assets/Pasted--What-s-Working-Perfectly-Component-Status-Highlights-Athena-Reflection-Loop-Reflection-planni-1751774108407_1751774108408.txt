✅ What’s Working Perfectly
Component Status Highlights
Athena Reflection Loop ✅ Reflection, planning, deduped output, pattern recognition
AgentForged Core ✅ PostgreSQL, Scheduler, Agent Zero API, Agent Pool
FamilyGenesis AI ✅ Sofia, Vincent, Claude initialized
Token System ⚠️ Working but using temp encryption key (fix below)
WebSocket Server ✅ Running at port 50002
API Routes ✅ Agent Zero API registered successfully
Template Seeder ✅ Found Athena template, skipped reseed

⚠️ Critical Fixes

🔐 TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY is missing
Impact: Tokens won’t persist across restarts. Security risk in prod.
Fix:

bash
Copy
Edit
node scripts/generate-encryption-key.js
Then set:

env
Copy
Edit
TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-generated-key
✅ This ensures encrypted tokens survive restarts and meet prod standards.

🚫 connect: connection refused on port 5000
This means:
Your Replit is forwarding port 5000 but...

No process is actually listening on that port at the time Replit forwards it.

Fix:
Make sure Express or Fastify (or whatever your server is) listens on:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.listen(process.env.PORT || 5000);
Or if you're using a custom runner (like dist/index.js), ensure it calls server.listen(5000) before anything that takes time (like agent init).

🔄 Repeated planning reflections
You’re seeing duplicate webhook triggers from planning, even after memory injection. This can be solved by:
Deduplicating webhook triggers

Tagging actions in memory

Skipping if already acknowledged

Planned encryption key generation and port checks (4 seconds)
I'll help you fix these critical issues. Let me start by addressing the TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY and then check the server configuration.


Executed cd /home/runner/workspace && ls scripts/

Planned encryption key generation sequence
Let me create the encryption key generation script and fix these issues:


Executed cd /home/runner/workspace && node generate-encryption-key.cjs

Strategized secret key implementation, port configuration
Now let me add the encryption key to Replit secrets and check the server configuration:

I've generated a secure encryption key for your application. Please add this key to your Replit secrets:
